This repository (DVA) has:
*  DVA (Drug virus association database)
* Collection of matrix completion based computational technqiues to predict anti-viral drug prediction for viruses


The raw data can be foundat: `data_raw/database.xlsx`

The processed data can be created using the notebook `read_database.ipynb`

![DVA-pipeline](./helper_functions/DVA.png).

The computational algorithms used to predict drug-virus association are available in: `helper_functions/alg_template`
